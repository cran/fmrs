------------------------
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-9
----------------------
CHANGES SINCE LAST TIME
    o The argument 'activeset' is added which allow flexiblity in defining
    customized fmrs models in terms of which covariates and intercepts
    should be included in each component.
    o A bug regarding calculating residuals and fitted values is fixed.
    o An alternative code is added and will be activated when the results of
    MLE of weibull distribution create 'NaN'. It is based on a component-wise
    algorithm and using survreg function in survival package to find MLE.

 BUG FIXES
    o Fixed a bug related to calculating fitted values and residuals.

------------------------
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-8
----------------------
CHANGES SINCE LAST TIME
    o We have implemented the Zhang(2010)'s suggestion for selecting extra
    tuning parameter in MCP penalty.
    o We have added an option for choosing extra tuning parameter in SICA
    penalty.

------------------------
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-7
----------------------
IMPROVEMENTS SINCE LAST TIME
    o We have implemented S4 classes and methods in this release.

CHANGES SINCE LAST TIME
    o Since S4 methods are implemented we have changed some arguments and
    definitions in this release.
    o fmrs object is changed to fmrsfit.
    o tunpar object is changed to fmrstunpar
    o You can no longer use $ to call the arguments of objects since they are
    written in S4 classes. Use @ instead.
    o New methods added to the package (see the manual).

------------------------
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-5
----------------------
IMPROVEMENTS SINCE LAST TIME
    o We have refined some of the codes to speed up the package.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
    o We intend to make some refinements to the package by introducing better
    S4 classes and methods.
    o We will add more distributions to the package including Generalized Gamma
    and Gompertz.
    o Since we are working on length-biased models, these models will be added
    to the package.

BUG FIXES
    o None reported so far.

------------------------
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-4
------------------------

IMPROVEMENTS SINCE LAST TIME
    o Compatibility with bioconductor is added.
